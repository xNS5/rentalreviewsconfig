# Rental Reviews Configuration

I initially though it would be a good idea to utilize firebase to store all configuration files, but because I'm somewhat cheap I wanted to reduce the number of requests for data that essentially wouldn't change with any frequency, namely configuration files. I've since scrapped that idea, however I think there's some benefit to using this project to host those configuration files -- namely for the navbar, metadata, footer, etc.

I might mess with this more, but for the time being this is just for the `config.json` file which is a kind of do-it-all configuration file I'm using.
